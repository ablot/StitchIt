StitchIt Change Log

04/01/19
- MAJOR: syncAndCrunch runs the web preview as a background task so it keeps up better with high bandwidth acquisitions.
         You can now change which channel is being sent to the web by editing the file at /tmp/buildSectionRunnerTargetChannel so you you could do: echo "3" > /tmp/buildSectionRunnerTargetChannel
- mhd_write and the YAML reader are integrated into the repo, making instalation easier.

04/08/18
- Bugfix: was failing to read z voxel size correctly.
- Now reads the most recent BakingTray recipe file, even if there are multiple.

13/07/18
- MAJOR: syncAndCrunch has new call system! See "help syncAndCrunch" and note you need to edit your INI file. See the default INI file and https://github.com/BaselLaserMouse/StitchIt/wiki/Setting-up-syncAndCrunch

18/06/18
- MAJOR - BakingTray tiles can be manipulated (undistorted and affine transformed) to allow for better stitching. User must edit StitchingParameters.VoxelSize in recipe to tweak mics per pixel if needed.
- MAJOR - Bugfix in BakingTray tile loader means the tileRotate parameter in the INI file will likely 
need changing. 


18/05/02
- MAJOR: Allow for optional tile rotation during image loading. Note the new tileRotate argument to the INI file under the "tile" section. 
- Average image tile collation is now only performed during syncAndCrunch for the first few sections and then again at the end. 

17/12/10 
- preProcessTiles now takes paramater/value pairs as input arguments
- Image offset is read from ScanImage file header and is not calculated. 

17/10/16
- MAJOR: stitching-related parameters (including average images) are now stored in a separate location 
         to the raw data. So data sets processed prior to this date will need preprocessing again. 
         Suggest you first delete existing average images, as they take up a lot of space. 
- Bugfix to cope with a situation where the user starts acquiring data from an extra channel mid-way
  through the acquisition. 

17/10/10
- MAJOR: coefficients needed to stitch images (with the exception of the tileIndex) are now kept 
         in rawData/stitchitPreProcessingFiles/. You will need to update your INI file by copying
         the relevant bit from the default INI file.


17/10/06
- MAJOR: Offset subtraction is now set via the INI file. You will see warnings on screen until you add 
         this setting to your INI file.
- Improvements in the way the offset correction is performed.
- Remove calcAverageBinFiles since we now only calculate the newer .mat files


17/09/21
- MAJOR: Enable offset correction in bakingtray.tileLoad. This seems necessary for Femto amps as they drift. 


17/09/21
- Bugfix to illumination corrector: error was generated if average file could not be found. 


17/07/13
- Average tiles saved as a structure.
- syncAndCrunch works with BakingTray where sections are saved directly to a "rawData" directory.
- Remove "averageSlowRows" option from INI file. 
- Ability to stitch and average rectangular frames from BakingTray. 


17/05/11
 - Improve docs and bug fix in stitchAllChannels.

17/05/04: 
 - MAJOR: take away the option to remove channel 3 in syncAndCrunch
 - BakingTray: moved to ScanImage multi-channels TIFFs. No longer reads split channels.
 - Fix regression that was causing average image correction to fail with BT data
 - Peeksection now stitches the first available channel by default. Not channel 2. 
 - DEVELOPER NOTE: meta-data format is now documented (help readMetaData2Stitchit)
 - DEVELOPER NOTE: image processing moved out of tileLoad functions

17/05/02
- Add makeCompositeOfPlane.m, which creates composite RGB images for use in Fiji with Bioformats

17/03/12
- MAJOR: stitchAllSubDirectories is now stitchAllChannels. please see "help stitchAllChannels"
- MAJOR: The syncAndCrunch has new default values for the inputs:
    * "combCorChans" argument now defaults to 1.
    * "illumChans" argument now automatically selects all available channels.
    * "chanToPlot" argument now automatically selects the first channel in illumChans.
- buildSectionPreview by default chooses the first available channel if none are provided.
- stitchSection will not proceed if the requested operation will fill the disk.
- syncAndCrunch does not proceed if local and server dirs are the same.
- Disk space reporter now works on Windows as well as Mac/Linux.
- Delete web directory (forWWW) at completion of syncAndCrunch.
- DEVELOPER NOTE: Minor bugfixes, cleanup (isfield calls relating to the INI file), mass tabs to spaces conversion.

17/03/09
- MAJOR: identifyMissingTilesInDir now optionally replaces missing tiles with adjacent ones in the same x/y positition instead of blank tiles. (Merged commit from Natalia Chicherova, Fouga fork).
- Renamed postAcqfFun to  postAcqFun in the INI file. (BREAKS EXISTING INI FILES)

17/03/03
- saveMatrixAsCSV now runs on Windows.
- DEVELOPER NOTE: Read BakingTray v0.5 recipe files.

17/02/28
- mergeChannels incorporates in place the addition, subtraction, etc, functions from Yunyun Han.

17/02/21
- Seamless stitching bugfix so it works on more recent MATLAB versions. 

17/01/29
- syncAndCrunch checks if the user's repo is up to date (Unix only)

17/10/19
- Fix bug that was causing stitching not to begin when acquisition ended.
- DEVELOPER NOTE: some syncAndCrunch errors are now being saved to a file called StitchIt_Log.txt in the sample directory. Aids debugging.

16/11/22
- Go back to stitching *sections* in parallel instead of loading tiles in parallel. This is much faster. 

16/11/01
- DEVELOPER NOTE: BakingTray largely working. (beta feature)

16/05/01
- Move repo to GitHub
